Usage: PriLoadClient.exe ([-d|data "{dataFile}"] [-i|ini "{iniFile}"])

            ([-v|Verbose] | -v+|veryverbose] | [-v++|arcane])

Options (-|/):

    d|data "{dataFile}"
                   * Sets the {dataFile} that contains the tab delimited 
                   text file to be loaded. 

    i|ini "{iniFile}"
                   * Sets the {iniFile} that contains the definition 
                   of the loading. For more information regarding the
                   structure of the initialisation file try /? ini.

    q|enq "{qFile}"
                   * Re-queues an existing SOAP bubble file. This 
                   feature is provided to enqueue SOAP bubbles that 
                   have been created but not accepted by the queue. 
                   This option cannot be used in conjunction with the 
                   -d and -i switches. 

    r|register     Register the application with the windows event 
                   log. Note that this must be run manually prior to 
                   using the program so that events from the client are 
                   captured to the Windows event log. Not also that 
                   this switch must be run by an .\administrator

    e|event        Specify that the server should notify the caller 
                   when the loading has been transmitted.

    del|delete     Specify that the data file should be discarded once
                   the client receives confirmation that the bubble is
                   enqued.
                   
    w|wait         Specify that the client should wait for keypress
                   before terminating.

    V|+|++         Set the logging verbosity. If ommited then logging 
                   verbosity is set to normal, ie only generate Windows
                   event logs if an error condtion is raised. In 
                   verbose mode transmission sucsesses are also 
                   recorded. VeryVerbose (-v+) and Arcane (-v++) switches
                   provide additional levels of logging and are used
                   for debugging.
 
    -?|h|help {helpType}
                   {helpType} is optional. If ommited the command displays 
                   this help file. Permitted values for {helpType} are "ini"
                   and "server", which display the help specific to the 
                   structure of initialisation file and valid switches for 
                   modifying the behaviour of the Priority Client Service 
                   respectively.

    *              If the filename contains spaces you MUST enclose 
                   the {FileName} in (") characters. Filenames may omit
                   the executable path if they are stored in or under
                   that path ie \file == {ExecutionPath}\file.
