This is a small time-saving marketing utility.

It grabs news and blog posts from the emerge website and formulates tweets for them.

It utilises the axd feed from the blog, and pages.xml from the website, extracting the title and URL for each tweetable item. 

It then creates a shortened URL utilising Bit.ly. 

It requests an XML response from Bit.ly which also contains a flag for new hashes - this is utilised to determine whether or not the item should be tweeted.

If the URL posted to bit.ly is new, the new hash flag will read 1 and the item will be tweeted. Presently it is set up with the twitter account EmgTest - this will need to be changed.
