This can be used with the C# implementation - RealexRemoteSample_CS or the ASP.NET implementation - RealexRemoteSample_ASP.NET
For C# you need to add your Merchant ID and Shared secret to the file  RealexRemoteSample_CS\RealexRemoteSample\RealAuth.cs
For ASP.NET you need to add your Merchant ID and Shared Secret to the file RealexRemoteSample_ASP.NET\sampleTransaction.aspx or RealexRemoteSample_ASP.NET\sampleSlightlyMoreComplicatedTransaction.aspx whichever you decide to use
