Syntax:

realexcli.exe | realexfrm.exe
	-config {/xpath [Value]}
	-test
	-authcode [value] -pasref [value] -id [value]
	-v
	-w
	-?
	
Notes:
realexcli.exe and realexfrm.exe are the same program. realexfrm.exe is 
called by windows and will only display the response message from Realex
in a dialog window. realexcli.exe is called from a command line and 
displays additional debug information for configuration and testing. 

Switches:
	-config
		Issued without additional arguments this switch will display the
		current configuration (xml).
	
		You can use the -config option to change a setting by also passing 
		setting values like this:
			/{setting_name} [newValue]
		where {setting name} is the xpath of the setting in the -config xml
		
	-test
		This creates a test payment and tries to void that transaction.
		Used only for debugging.
	
	-authcode | pasref | id
		The parameters of the transaction being voided.
		
	-v
		Verbose. More debug information
		
	-w
		Wait for a keypress after execution had completed.
