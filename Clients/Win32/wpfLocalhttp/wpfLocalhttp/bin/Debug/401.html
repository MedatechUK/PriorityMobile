                    Overview...</h2>
                <h3>
                    Welcome to the Priority HTTPixie server. </h3>
                <br />
                This application is designed to overcome limitations of cloud based Priority ERP 
                implimentations with regards the execution of locally installed applications in 
                a WIN32 environment. The application itself is a tiny HTTP (web) server - with a 
                footprint of under 100 kilobytes - based on the ntSocks .Net socket library 
                written by Simon Barnett.
                <br />
                <br />
                The WPF Desktop web service is bound to the internal loopback address of the 
                local network interface card and is therefore only accessible from the machine 
                on which the service is installed. Because the Priority HTTPixie server can only 
                be accessed from the machine upon which it is installed there are no security 
                issues with regards its use.<br />
                <br />
                Once installed the webserver processes HTTP requests sent to the localhost (ie 
                127.0.0.1), converting HTTP GET requests into shell commands in the local Win32 
                environment. Such HTTP requests can be made from within the Priority ERP by 
                using the SHELLEX compiled procedure (see syntax below). Attempts to open the 
                service in non-WIN32 environments (or in WIN32 environments where the service is 
                not installed) will simply return a 404, page not found, error.<br />
                <br />
                Becuase of the nature of this design any future version of the Priority ERP - or 
                indeed any other cloud based application that can open a URL - will be able to 
                support the opening of locally installed binaries (executables) in this fashion. 
                This is important, as future versions of the Priority ERP may be written in 
                Microsoft Silverlight, or even HTML 5.</fieldset>

                <h3>

                </h3> <font color="red">OPTIONAL</font> -
                The UNC (i.e. 
                \\{servername}\{sharename}\) or filing system (i.e. {drive letter}:\{folder}\) path that should be used as the working directory for the 
                requested executable. This may be ommited if the executable is accessible from 
                an ENVIRONMENT path. <br><br>For example, executables stored in the \%WINDIR% folder can be called without referencing a physical path to the working directory. If the executable you are starting resides on the filing system of the local machine it is preferable to add the working directory location to the systems ENVIRONMENT variable, so as to be able to leave this blank. 
                Doing so will ensure that the binary is correctly called, regardless of where it 
                is installed on the target machine. <br><br>This function is primarily included to handle instances where the desired binary needs to be run from a UNC path (i.e. not locally installed, but on the network).&nbsp;Note 
                that the direction of slashes is not significant, so c:/ is the same as c:\ and 
                //server/path is the same as \\server\path.<h3>
                   {Executable}
                </h3> The name of the binary to be executed. This <font color="red">MUST</font> include the ".exe" extention, as it is this which notifies the WPF Desktop service that the 
                incoming HTTP request is made with the intention of running a binary file.

                   {Parameters}

                    <br>The Priority HTTPixie service has several pre-defined response pages that may be returned to the calling HTTP client (i.e. web browser) when an HTTP request is recieved. Default response pages are installed as part standard installation but are simple HTML pages and may be modified 
                    as required.<br><br>The response pages are unique to each installation of the Priority HTTPixie service 
                    (they are installed on the local machine) and are to be found in the application 
                    folder that you chose during the install.<br /><br />
                    On this machine (\\$MACH$) they are stored in:<br />
                <font color="blue">$PATH$</font>.

                    <h3>Response Page Directives.</h3><br />
                        Response pages support a number of directives that can be included in the html response. These directives act as placeholders which will be replaced by their actual values at run-time, when the WPF Destop HTTP service responds to request from an HTTP Client. The list of supported directives is provided below.

                                error code of 200 indicates the sucsessful processing of the binary requested by
