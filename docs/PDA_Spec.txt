Any Windows Mobile device with .net and access to the GSM network for GPRS communication is sufficient. Usually you can pressure your service provider into giving you a device more than sufficient for the purpose free with your airtime contract.

Also if you are considering integrating GPS navigation into the device you should make sure that the device has GPS onboard, and has a ~4g memory SSD for maps.

If I were to express a preference, I’d recommend the latest HP Ipaq (which I have previously seen airtime providers throw in with the contract) because of its excellent build quality, sturdy reliability, built in GPS/WiFi/rs820 and nice integral keyboard. 

With that said the service engineer app itself will run quite happily, if somewhat sedately, on the 2003 ipaq I got from ebay for £40 with a £1 SIM card from Tesco, so you really don’t need an overspec device to get started.
