Windows Event CLI Logger Syntax:

   wevl.exe {-s|source {"[source]"} -m|msg|message {"[message]"}
         -t|type {info|warn|ok|fail|err}}|
         {-r -s|source {"[source]"})|
         {-? {-w}}

   wevl.exe
      The name of the binary - note that the installer copies the binaries 
      to the local system folder, so this execuatble can be called from any
      working directory without requiring the full path to the executable.
	  
   -? 
      This help file.

   -w 
      Wait for user input on completion.

   -s|source {"[source]"}
      The source name of the message. Note that sources must be manually 
      registered with the -r switch (by an administrator) if the user does 
      not have premission to create an event source. This parameter MUST be 
      specified for both LOG and REGISTER operations. If this contains 
      spaces it should be contained between speech marks "like this".

    -m|msg|message {"[message]"}
      The message to save to the windows event log. If this contains 
      spaces it should be contained between speech marks "like this".

   -t|type {info|warn|ok|fail|err}
      OPTIONAL - The type of log message. There are 5 standard event types
      in the Windows classic event log. These are:      
		- Error = error|err|er|1
		- Warning = warning|warn|2
		- Information = information|info|nfo|4
		- SuccessAudit = successaudit|success|suc|ok|8 
		- FailureAudit = failureaudit|fail|16
	  
	  Note: Any of the values listed on the right are valid responses for
	  parameters for the type shown on the left. E.g. to specify a log 
	  entry of Sucsess Audit the -s parameter could be any of the values:
	  successaudit OR success OR suc OR ok OR 8
	  
   -r 
      Register the event source specified by the -s switch as a source for 
      Windows events. 
      
Examples:
	To register a Windows Event Log source:
		wevl -r -s "[source]"
		
	To write a warning message to the event log:
		wevl -s "[Source]" -t warn -msg "[This is my message]"
