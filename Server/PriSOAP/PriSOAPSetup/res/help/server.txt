The Priority Loading Client Service is a Windows Service that provides SOAP 
bubble file stacking functionality. SOAP Bubbles created by the Client Service 
with the PriLoadClient executable are transmitted to the local client service, 
and stored in the stack until transmission to the SOAP service is possible.

You start and stop the service using the standard windows service tool. 
Additionaly you can start the service with the following switches to modify 
the behaviour of the service.

Options (-|/):

    s|soap         Set the URL of the SOAP service to connect to.
                   eg. http://mobile.domain.tld:8080

    v|+|++         Set the logging verbosity. Normal verbosity only generates 
                   Windows event logs if an error condtion is raised. In 
                   verbose mode transmission sucsesses are also 
                   recorded. VeryVerbose (-v+) and Arcane (-v++) switches
                   provide additional levels of logging and are used
                   for debugging. 

    v-|quiet       Remove verbosity (ie set back to normal
                   verbosity).
                   
Note that once specified the values of switches are recorded for future use,
so if you raise the debugging level with the /v switch remember to turn it off 
again with the /v- switch afterwards!

Event logs generated by the service are stored in the Windows application log.
