Usage: PriLoadClient.exe [-d|data "{dataFile}"] [-i|ini "{iniFile}"]
            [-r|register] [-e|event] [-w|wait] [-?|h|help "{helpFile}"]
            ([-v|Verbose] | -v+|veryverbose] | [-v++|arcane])

Options (-|/):

    d|data "{dataFile}"
                   * Sets the {dataFile} that can contain either the tab 
                   delimited text file that will be formatted using the
                   specified {iniFile}, or pre-formatted bubble data with 
                   the /q switch set. 

    i|ini "{iniFile}"
                   * Sets the {iniFile} that contains the definition 
                   of the loading. For more information regarding the
                   structure of the initialisation file try /? ini.
                   If specified the client will use this to create a 
                   new bubble file

    q|enq          * Specifies that the {dataFile} contains a pre-formatted 
                   bubble file to the Queue. If ommited an {iniFile} is
                   required. You can also use this switch to re-queue SOAP 
                   bubbles that have been created with an {iniFile} but have
                   not accepted by the local queue. 

    e|event        When used in conjunction with a {dataFile} this tells the 
                   local server to monitor the loading and collect event
                   data. Event data is read from the local loading service
                   by using the /e switch without a {dataFile} specified.
                   
    r|register     Register the application with the windows event 
                   log. Note that this must be run manually prior to 
                   using the program so that events from the client are 
                   captured to the Windows event log. Not also that 
                   this switch must be run by an .\administrator

    del|delete     Specify that the {dataFile} should be deleted once
                   the client receives confirmation from the local service
                   that the bubble is enqued.
                   
    w|wait         Specify that the client should wait for keypress
                   before terminating.

    v|+|++         Set the logging verbosity. If ommited then logging 
                   verbosity is set to normal, ie only generate Windows
                   event logs if an error condtion is raised. In 
                   verbose mode transmission sucsesses are also 
                   recorded. VeryVerbose (-v+) and Arcane (-v++) switches
                   provide additional levels of logging and are used
                   for debugging.
 
    -?|h|help {helpType}
                   {helpType} is optional. If ommited the command displays 
                   this help file. Permitted values for {helpType} are "ini"
                   and "server", which display the help specific to the 
                   structure of initialisation file and valid switches for 
                   modifying the behaviour of the Priority Client Service 
                   respectively.

    *              If the filename contains spaces you MUST enclose 
                   the {FileName} in (") characters. Filenames may omit
                   the executable path if they are stored in or under
                   that path ie \file == {ExecutionPath}\file.
